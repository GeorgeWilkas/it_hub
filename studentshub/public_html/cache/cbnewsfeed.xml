<p style="text-align: center;">üéâ <em>Joomla 5.0.3, 4.4.3 and 3.10.15-elts are released and it's a safe upgrade!</em> ü•≥</p>
<p>The Joomla project has issued Joomla 5.0.3, 4.4.3, and 3.10.15-elts, focusing on security and bug fixes. These updates emphasize Joomla's ongoing commitment to accessible web design, inclusiveness, simplicity, and security.</p>
<h3>Important Security Update</h3>
<p>There releases address several security vulnerabilities, including one of high severity and two of moderate severity. For a complete list of the five security fixes, please see the <a href="https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5904-joomla-5-0-3-and-4-4-3-security-and-bug-fix-release.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Joomla 5.0.3 and 4.4.3 announcement</a>.</p>
<h3>Notable improvements in Joomla 5.0.3</h3>

<ol>
<li>Resolving correct display of messages on error pages</li>
<li>Fixed background in full-screen mode in Code Mirror editor</li>
<li>Updated translations</li>
</ol>
<h3>Community Builder Security</h3>
<p>We have security-audited <strong>Community Builder </strong>for these Joomla security findings, confirming it <strong>does not contain the vulnerabilities</strong> addressed in these Joomla releases.</p>
<p>Moreover, <strong>sites using exclusively CB for user management are protected</strong> from the high severity issue (affecting past Joomla 4 and 5 versions and fixed by 4.4.3 and 5.0.3 ).</p>
<p>CB sites are also mostly protected from <strong>one of the two</strong> moderate severity issues (affecting past Joomla 3.7+ versions and fixed in 3.10.15-elts, 4.4.3, and 5.0.3). Our dedication to security, with all changes to Community Builder being security-reviewed, ensures your website remains protected when using Community Builder.</p>
<p>We recommend the latest Joomla updates for all CB sites.</p>

<p>Joomla's Security Strike Team works tirelessly to identify and address potential web threats, ensuring the platform remains secure and reliable. The release of Joomla 5.0.3, 4.4.3, and 3.10.15-elts demonstrates their ongoing efforts to protect your website and its users.</p>

Stay current with Joomla updates for the best possible experience for your website's users and a secure online environment.</p>

			<title>Community Builder 2.9.1 released: Embracing new PHP 8.3!</title>
			<link>https://www.joomlapolis.com/news/19033-community-builder-2-9-1-released</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.joomlapolis.com/news/19033-community-builder-2-9-1-released</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://www.joomlapolis.com/images/jpnewsletter/jpn202312/CB_2.9.1_released_640x360.jpg" alt="Community Builder 2.9.1 Joomla 3.10-5.0 native!! Runs on PHP 7.4-8.3!" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">üéâ <em>Community Builder 2.9.1 released: Embracing new PHP 8.3!</em> ü•≥</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">¬†</p>
<p>We're excited to announce the release of Community Builder 2.9.1, a significant update that introduces verified support for the latest PHP 8.3 release. With this integration, Community Builder ensures compatibility with the newest advancements in PHP technology. This update also includes an updated and more friendly handling of obsolescence warnings for old unmaintained versions of PHP, MySQL and Joomla, providing more clarity and guidance on maintaining up-to-date server environments.</p>
<h3>PHP 8.3 Compatibility and Performance Boost</h3>
<p><strong>PHP 8.3</strong>, recently released by the PHP development team, brings a host of improvements, including a <strong>notable 28% speed increase for Joomla</strong>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/php-benchmarks/#joomla" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">as benchmarked here</a>.</p>
<p>It's important to note that <strong>PHP 8.0 has reached its end of life for security support</strong>, and PHP 8.1 is no longer receiving bug-fix maintenance releases. While Linux distributions might offer minimal security maintenance, <strong>we strongly recommend selecting an officially supported PHP version (currently 8.3, 8.2 or 8.1)</strong> for your site through your hosting panel.</p>
<p>üîó All our <strong>latest CB and CB Add-ons</strong> have been tested and <strong>run seamlessly on PHP 8.3</strong>, ensuring a smooth experience for your Joomla-powered community websites.</p>
<p>Our demo site is already running on PHP 8.3, showcasing the compatibility and stability of Community Builder with the latest PHP release.</p>
<h3>Upgrade Now for Peak Performance and Security</h3>
<p>üëâ Upgrade to Community Builder 2.9.1 and PHP 8.3 today to benefit from these advancements and ensure your community site is running on a secure and efficient PHP environment. Thank you for being a part of the Joomlapolis community, and stay tuned for more updates and improvements!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">üéâ <em>Joomla 5.0.1, 4.4.1 and 3.10.14-elts are released and it's a safe upgrade!</em> ü•≥</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Joomla project has released versions 5.0.1, 4.4.1, and 3.10.14-elts, addressing a very-low-probability vulnerability that affects Joomla versions 1.6 to 3.10.12, 4.4.0 and 5.0.0.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This vulnerability is of very low probability, as it requires the site super-administrator to have given to the attacker editing access to the language files, to potentially expose environment variables that may contain sensitive information.</p>
<h3><strong>Security Update Instructions</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Joomla 5.0.1 and 4.4.1: Easily update through the standard built-in Joomla updater.</li>
<li>Joomla 3.10.14-elts: Consider upgrading your Joomla 3.10 site to Joomla 4.4.1 instead (see below for instructions). If not possible, consider subscribing to the official 18-months Joomla Extended Long-Term Security support program, while planing an upgrade to 4.4.1 and 5.0.1. Visit <a href="https://elts.joomla.org/" target="_new">elts.joomla.org</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Improvements in Joomla 5.0.1:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Update of TinyMCE Editor to the Latest Version</li>
<li>Conditional Dark Mode in Editors</li>
<li>Enhanced Information in Custom Fields for Finder Indexing</li>
<li>Improvement of Messenger View</li>
<li>Several Language and Code Style Improvements</li>
<li>CLI Installer Fixes and Improvements</li>
<li>Fix SVG Display in Media Manager List View</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">¬†</p>
<h2>Joomla 5.0 and Joomla 4.4: A New Era Begins</h2>
<p><em>Secure, Accessible, Fast, Extendable - Unleash the Power of Joomla 5.0!</em></p>
<p>Today is a momentous day for the Joomla! Project and its global community. After two years of dedicated work, discussions, code sprints, and relentless bug squashing, we're thrilled by the release of Joomla 5.0, a major milestone in Joomla's history, alongside Joomla 4.4.</p>
<h3>Joomla 5.0: An Upgrade, No More Migrations</h3>
<p>Joomla 5.0 brings a wealth of new features, security enhancements, and a remarkable boost in performance. Under the hood, every aspect has been meticulously redesigned and optimized, harnessing the latest server technologies. It's a platform designed to grow with you, whether you're an individual blogger, a nonprofit organization, a web agency, a multinational corporation, or working for a government.</p>
<p>Transitioning from Joomla 4.4.x to Joomla 5.x is now a straightforward upgrade, akin to any minor version upgrade, eliminating the need for complex migrations.</p>
<h3>Discover Joomla 5.0's Key Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Guided Tours have been massively improved and many new Joomla tours have been added to Joomla 5.0. Joomla 5.0 also introduces a dark mode for administrators and the new Joomla modal window for select buttons, as well as many small improvements, promising a more refined experience.</li>
<li><strong>Boosted website speed:</strong> Joomla 5.0 includes enhancements in web asset caching, automatic source code optimization with phpcs, and cleaner code base, resulting in a remarkably faster, smoother, and more efficient platform. Several scheduled tasks have been moved to scheduler plugins, for optimal performance.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced search engine optimization (SEO):</strong> Automatic activation of Schema.org data for organization and site names brings Joomla to new SEO heights, out of the box.</li>
<li><strong>The latest HTML editor:</strong> The new TinyMCE editor version 6.7 offers many refinements, in particular additional images alignments.</li>
<li><strong>Media Management:</strong> AVIF support in the media manager and the ability to exclude archived content from smart search indexing improve media handling capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Menu Sorting:</strong> Joomla 5.0 empowers you to sort your menu the way you want.</li>
<li><strong>Modern Technologies:</strong> Internal code restructuring and cleanliness focuses on using modern APIs, transitioning from older APIs, removing obsolete ES5 support for efficient operation and includes added JS Import map support for Web Asset Manager. Every library has been updated to latest standards.</li>
<li><strong>PHP &amp; Bootstrap Updates:</strong> Improved compatibility with PHP 8+ with a minimum set at PHP 8.1 and MySQL 8.0.13/MariaDB 10.4, and an update to Bootstrap 5.3.2 keep Joomla contemporary.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Security improvements include migrating events to their classes and removing obsolete Recaptcha plugins.</li>
<li><strong>Extensions Compatibility:</strong> Most modern Joomla 3.10 and 4 extensions should run just fine in Joomla 5.0, with the introduction of a core Compatiblity plugin, moving legacy code support into a single place for added performance and easy native compatibility tests.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Upgrade to Joomla 5.0</h3>
<p>Good news for Joomla 4.4.x users - it's an upgrade, not a migration. Joomla 4 extensions that have kept pace with Joomla's latest code will work seamlessly in Joomla 5. Most others can function with the new Behavior - Backward Compatibility Plugin enabled.</p>
<p>Joomla recommends to upgrade a copy of your site and check it out first. You may probably want to update or restyle your Joomla template just after the upgrade.</p>
<p>Full upgrade details can be found <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/Joomla_4.4.x_to_5.x_Planning_and_Upgrade_Step_by_Step">in the Joomla documentation</a>. We too recommend strongly testing the upgrade on a copy of your production site first.</p>
<h3>Why Rush? Joomla 4.4 Supported for 2 More Years</h3>
<p>No need to rush; Joomla 4.4 will be supported for two more years, ensuring your site's security. Many extensions have already prepared Joomla 5 versions, making the transition smooth and painless.</p>
<h3>Why Not Rush? Boost your site speed, SEO and user experience!</h3>
<p>However, you should definitely consider upgrading to Joomla 4.4 now and make plans for the imminent transition to Joomla 5.0. This proactive step will not only enhance your site's visibility on search engines and improve its ranking but also elevate your users' experience through enhanced usability and speed. Additionally, reducing the consumption of server resources for page rendering is not only beneficial for your users, but also contributes positively to the environment and the climate.</p>
<h3>What About Joomla 4.4?</h3>
<p>Joomla 4.4 focuses on providing a very smooth upgrade path, by not introducing new features, except the upgrade tester. It is thus a safe and mandatory step in your upgrade to Joomla 5.0.</p>
<p>Behind the curtains, Joomla 4.4's automated build tests have been massively extended, going from only 17 automated application tests to over 400, with thousands of simulated clicks and tested replies. Same is being added to Joomla 5.0. This will bring Joomla's already legendary stability to unseen levels. This allows smooth upgrades in full confidence. This an additional reason why we can already recommend upgrades from Joomla 4.3.4 to 4.4.0.</p>
<h3>What About Community Builder?</h3>
<p>Community Builder and all add-on nightly releases have been adapted to run on Joomla 5.0 natively (this means that it runs also with the Joomla Compatibility Plugin disabled). New "stable" releases for CB and all add-ons will be released next week.</p>
<p>CB will now be checking for installed PHP and MySQL/MariaDB versions, and display an information banner if your server runs below PHP 8.1 or MySQL 8.0.13/MariaDB 10.4 versions required for Joomla 5. We plan to increase our minimum PHP and database versions requirements in the future, to align with Joomla's latest ones. Sites also load faster with latest PHP versions, so it's anyway recommended to use latest PHP versions.</p>

<h3>Beyond Joomla 5.0: A Bright Future Awaits</h3>
<p>In the making for over two years, Joomla 5.0 has been crafted by hundreds of developers who are also daily Joomla users. It reflects the practical needs of Joomla users, incorporating modernizations and improvements.

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.joomlapolis.com/news/19021-celebrate-cb-19th-birthday-joomla-18th-anniversary</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://www.joomlapolis.com/images/jpnewsletter/jpn202309/fireworks_2023_640.jpg" alt="Fireworks" width="640" height="373" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">üéâ Celebrate with Us: <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/{URLCommunityBuilder}">Community Builder</a>'s 19th Birthday and <a href="https://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Joomla!</a>s 18th Anniversary! ü•≥</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">¬†</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">¬†The time has come to break out the virtual party hats and pop some confetti cannons because we've got not one but two fantastic reasons to celebrate! Community Builder is turning 19, and Joomla is hitting the big 18. üéâ</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">üåü <strong>Remembering Our Roots</strong>: A Walk Down Memory Lane with Community Builder</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">It all started on <strong>August 30, 2004</strong>, when Community Builder (CB) made its debut with version 1.0.0 beta 1 (even the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040903192542/http://www.mambojoe.com/content/view/3/2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Internet Archive has catched it immediately in 2004!</a>). It was like welcoming a new friend who would transform our Mambo and Joomla websites into bustling social hubs. CB began with the basics‚Äîuser profiles and community building‚Äîand oh boy, what a journey it's been!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From avatars and messaging to enhanced privacy controls and customization galore, CB evolved with each release. It introduced features like the Activity Stream, advanced userlists, and many add-ons like CBSubs for subscription management. Millions of downloads later, <strong>CB is the go-to choice for building thriving online communities!</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">üí° <strong>Enriching Community Builder</strong>: Explore Our CB Add-Ons</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">As we celebrate Community Builder's remarkable journey, we'd like to shine a spotlight on the incredible contributions of our supportive members. With a <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/memberships">Professional or Developer membership</a>, you gain access to a treasure trove of <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons">CB add-ons</a> that have been meticulously crafted over the years, enhancing the capabilities of Community Builder.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our collection includes a range of powerful extensions, each designed to elevate your community-building experience. These add-ons make Community Builder even more flexible and tailorable to a broad range of uses, ranging from clubs to corporate websites and large governmental organizations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For instance, <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons/cb-paid-subscriptions">CB Paid Subscriptions (CBSubs)</a> revolutionizes subscription management, making it a breeze to handle memberships and subscriptions. With <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons/cb-activity">CB Activity</a>, you can create dynamic and engaging activity streams that keep your community members informed and connected like never before. And <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons/cb-groupjive">CB GroupJive</a> empowers you and your users to create and manage user groups, effectively turning them into mini-communities. It also enables you or your group administrators to organize events, send invitations, and allows their mini-communities members to share photos, videos, files. It also seamlessly integrates with forums. As last but not least example, extensive privacy can be handled through <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons/cb-privacy">CB Privacy</a> add-on. All these extensions have also been made available as a pre-configured <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons/cb-quickstart">CB Quickstart</a> installer.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">üåü <strong>Active Engagement</strong>: Our Thriving Forums</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">What's more, our <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/forum">thriving forum</a> serves as a vibrant hub where the community actively participates in discussions, asks questions, and provides invaluable feedback and suggestions. It's this active engagement that guides us in continuously improving CB and its add-ons, ensuring they meet your evolving needs.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">üöÄ <strong>The Future Beckons</strong>: Get Ready for CB Activity 6.0 and CB 3.0!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">While we're reminiscing about the past, let's also talk about the future! Get ready for a soon release of a major completely rewritten CB Activity 6.0 add-on, which is in the making since over a year. And Community Builder 3.0 should be coming your way next year! Maybe even around the 20th birthday of Community Builder ? This won't be just a release; it will be a community engagement revolution. We've listened to your feedback and will be rolling out a treasure trove of features that will dazzle Joomla website administrators and community managers alike.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">ü§™ <strong>The Funny Fact</strong>: <strong>CB 2.8.1‚ÄîReleased Exactly on CB's 19th Birthday!</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">¬†</p>
<p>At Joomlapolis, we are proud to announce the new maintenance-release <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/{URLCommunityBuilder}"><strong>Community Builder 2.8.1</strong></a>, refining the functionality of CB 2.8 for online communities, with <strong>10 new features¬†</strong>to amplify user experiences and<strong> 21 issues fixed, </strong>some of which are<strong> significant improvements</strong>, especially for Joomla 4 sites.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>With a vibrant user base and an unwavering commitment to open-source principles, Joomlapolis continues to empower hundreds of thousands community managers and dozens of millions users alike.</p>
<p><strong>CB 2.8.1</strong> is compatible with <strong>Joomla 4 (currently at 4.3.4) </strong>and<strong> Joomla 3.10* (currently at 3.10.12), as well as with all our latest<a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons"><strong> CB add-ons</strong></a></strong>.</p>
<h3>Striving for Continuous Improvement, One Detail at a Time</h3>
<p>While these may not be big changes, the small improvements in Community Builder 2.8.1 will make a noticeable difference. New features introduced by CB 2.8.1 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Even More Flexible Profile Layouts</strong>: Enhancements in placeholder substitutions provide site administrators with a greater level of control over profile layouts. This subtle customization option adds new possibilities to user profiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fine-Tuned Joomla System Fields</strong>: We introduce publishing statuses control for Joomla system fields, reducing clutter on user profile edits by allowing the hiding of unneeded system information and settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embracing Enhanced Security</strong>: The inclusion of the W3C Web authentication plugin reflects our steadfast commitment to safeguarding user data and privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Database Collation Checks</strong>: A pragmatic tool for assessing database collations ensures a smoother and faster user experience by maintaining database integrity, now also on character-set collations for CB tables and columns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dual CB Date Display</strong>: By imbuing CB date fields with dual functionality‚Äîdisplaying both age and birth dates‚Äîwe foster deeper connections among users while displaying accurate dates if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refined Aesthetics</strong>: While seemingly subtle, the optimization of CSS styles on specific CB pages contributes to a more harmonious and precise visual experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improving Stability and Future-proofing</h3>
<p>Beyond these improvements, <strong>Community Builder 2.8.1</strong> diligently includes 21 pertinent bug fixes, the most important being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Form Token Enhancement</strong>: We bid adieu to form timeouts with the inclusion of missing keep-alive form tokens rectifying the issue of timeouts in forms, and allowing for uninterrupted user engagement when users get ‚Ä¶ interrupted for a long time while filling in a form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Joomla 4 Compatibility</strong>: We ensure Joomla 4 compatibility remains seamless by also saving Joomla user parameters on CB profile edits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-Language Compatibility</strong>: Multi-language sites within Joomla 4 receive the attention they deserve, as we resolve a Joomla 4 compatibility issue to foster inclusivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PHP 8.2 Support</strong>: By fxiing PHP 8.2 deprecation notices, we guarantee sustained performance on modern server environments and future-proofing for next PHP 8.3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smoother User Importing</strong>: We enhanced user management through improved user importing, streamlining data formatting and error detection during user imports.</p>
</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5861-joomla-4-1-5-and-3-10-10-release.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Joomla 4.3 is here with Guided Tours!</a></p>
<p><strong>Joomla 4.3</strong> introduced <strong>Guided Tours</strong>, <strong>a game-changing feature!</strong></p>
<p>Guided Tours is now the first top menu in the Joomla administration, guiding new users in creating their first article, adding a category, or menu. This <strong>interactive walkthrough</strong> redefines how users engage with Joomla 4.3, offering <strong>step-by-step guidance for seamless onboarding</strong>, personalized learning, and enhanced satisfaction. We believe that by spotlighting features and empowering new users, guided tours are set to redefine how users interact with Joomla 4.3+ and will significantly boost Joomla's uptake.</p>
<h3>Simplified Onboarding</h3>
<p>Newcomers can navigate Joomla 4.3 effortlessly with guided tours. Interactive prompts and tooltips provide intuitive step-by-step guidance, reducing the learning curve and boosting confidence.</p>
<h3>Contextual Learning</h3>
<p>Guided tours provide real-time context, allowing users to learn as they explore. Tailored explanations while using the platform bridge the gap between <strong>what</strong> users want to do and <strong>how</strong> to do it, enhancing learning effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Empowered Users</h3>
<p>With guided tours in Joomla 4.3, new users gain a solid grasp of the platform in record time. They're less likely to need extensive documentation or support, making their Joomla experience smoother and more independent.</p>
<h3>Accessibility at the Core</h3>
<p>Joomla's commitment to accessibility extends to its guided tours, ensuring that people with disabilities can fully benefit from the feature. Just like the entire Joomla platform, guided tours are designed with inclusivity in mind.</p>
<h3>Tailored Experience</h3>
<p>Joomla's guided tours aim to cater to diverse expertise levels. Beginners receive comprehensive guidance, while advanced users can skip introductory tours, ensuring personalized assistance as more advanced tours get gradually added.</p>
<h3>Create your own Tours</h3>
<p>Moreover, you have the possibility to create your own guided tours specific to your site to assist your users' onboarding or to help them discover and use new site feature.</p>
<h3>Joomla 4.3's Additional Features</h3>
<p>Joomla 4.3 brings many more new features, including a revamped Media Manager, workflow improvements, enhanced tags, custom fields, and menus. It also upgrades to Bootstrap version 5.2 and enhances support for PHP 8.2.</p>
<h3>Stay Up to Date with Joomla 4.3.4</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Joomla released version 4.3.4, a maintenance release that improves and fixes minor bugs. We encourage all users to stay up to date to ensure they have the best experience with Joomla.</p>
<h3>In Summary<strong><br /></strong></h3>
<p>We think that Guided Tours will redefine user interaction in Joomla 4 by simplifying onboarding, enabling contextual learning, and unveiling hidden features. This feature exemplifies Joomla's commitment to a user-centric approach that enhances engagement and success, all while driving an increased uptake of the Joomla platform.</p>
